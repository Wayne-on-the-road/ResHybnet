# Introduction
The whole experiment is based on a sample graph dataset from CERT4.2. The sampled user-day nodes and train-test splitting are the same as our previous work (B-CITD) . The code and data here consists of three parts:
## 0. Sequence pre-processing
All the pre-processing work of sequential activities for user-days are included in file directory (*[code_for_sequence_process](https://github.com/Wayne-on-the-road/ResHybnet/tree/main/code_for_sequence_process "code_for_sequence_process")*). To try this procedure out, one needs to download the four log files ('logon.csv', 'device.csv', 'file.csv', 'email.csv') used from original  [CERT4.2](https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/dataset/Insider_Threat_Test_Dataset/12841247/1?file=24856766)dataset, since it is too big for uploading them here. The other alternative for file downloading is from our personal cloud link here.
Put downloaded .csv file in *[cert4.2_data](https://github.com/Wayne-on-the-road/ResHybnet/tree/main/code_for_sequence_process/cert4.2_data "cert4.2_data")* directory and run the two .py files one by one will generate the activity sequence for each user-day sample in our sample dataset, which can be used as input dataset for LSTM feature extraction in the next stage, and will be stored in *[sample_data](https://github.com/Wayne-on-the-road/ResHybnet/tree/main/code_for_sequence_process/sample_data "sample_data")* directory. 

This directory is just for trial and demonstration, and it is not necessary for later steps, since all the sample data needed have already been included in another separated directory. 

## 1. Use LSTM auto-encoder to extract features from sequential activity
To try this part, one only needs to include the *[sample_data](https://github.com/Wayne-on-the-road/ResHybnet/tree/main/sample_data "sample_data")* directory from main branch, and run the [lstm_feature_extraction.py](https://github.com/Wayne-on-the-road/ResHybnet/blob/main/lstm_feature_extraction.py "lstm_feature_extraction.py"). After training,  a new directory call *[lstm_feature_extraction_result](https://github.com/Wayne-on-the-road/ResHybnet/tree/main/lstm_feature_extraction_result "lstm_feature_extraction_result")* will be generated to store the result. Sequence length could be set inside program.

## 2. Detection with ResHybnet model
To try this part, one needs to include the *[sample_data](https://github.com/Wayne-on-the-road/ResHybnet/tree/main/sample_data "sample_data")* directory from main branch, and run the [detection_with_ResHybnet.py](https://github.com/Wayne-on-the-road/ResHybnet/blob/main/detection_with_ResHybnet.py "detection_with_ResHybnet.py"). After training,  a new directory call *[detection_result](https://github.com/Wayne-on-the-road/ResHybnet/tree/main/detection_result "detection_result")* will be generated to store the result. Different model settings and feature combinations could be set inside program.
